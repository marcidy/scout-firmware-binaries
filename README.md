# Binariers
The binary files in this repository are the complied micropython firmware for the two microcontrollers used in this project.

## Buoy
The buoy only has a heltec microcontroller, so only the heltec.bin firmware is needed.

## Handset
The handset has both a heltec microntroller and an espressif devkit-c.  Flash the appropriate firmware.

# Flashing the firmware
Please refer to the micropython or espressif ESP-IDF instructions on flashing the firmware.
